/* You should develop a very simple game in which the computer creates a random integer number between 1..100. 
The user then tries to guess the number. The program should work as specified below:

- The computer creates a random number
- The user guess the number
- The computer respond by printing one of :

You have guessed xx times and your guess is correct. Or
Your guess is to low or to high.

- If wrong the user is asked for a new guess, this will continue until the guess is right or the number
of guesses exceeds the value MAX_NUMBER.
- After end of one round the user is asked for a new round or to finish.
The program should only except guessed numbers in the range of 1 â€¦100.
An option, but not a demand, is to secure that the program not fail (crashes) if a user by
accident put in any character instead of a number. */
